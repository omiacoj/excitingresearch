The 'Exciting Research' is an ongoing  research about the  excitement-measurements collected and  visualized by a device MOODYÂ® -  intending to make the third upgrade -  hanging on the ear, a jewel/ earring.  It shows the individual excitements of the  people by measuring the temperature of  the ear. And by measuring distances  between each other, it will give us data to  visualize the 'Energies between People'.
